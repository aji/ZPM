ZPM -- Zero-Point Module

ZPM charges all neighboring energy sinks (anything with the IEnergySink
interface which includes all IC2 machines and storage blocks.) Storage
blocks (the MFSU, MFE, and BatBox) are filled at a rate of 1/20th their
capacity per tick, meaning an empty storage block will be filled in a
single second.

Contact aji on EsperNet if you have questions. If you're interested in
Minecraft modding, you should be there anyway.
