			ZPM 1.3dev -- Zero-Point Module
			      For Minecraft 1.2.5


INTRODUCTION

  This mod adds a block to the game which can either drain or fill
  adjacent energy storage units. The exact definition of "drain" or "fill"
  depends on the storage block it is targeted at, but the basic principle
  is the same. The block has no recipe. This is because it is intended
  for creative-mode play only. Right clicking the block will toggle it
  between drain and fill modes. This mod is written for Minecraft 1.2.5,
  and requires Minecraft Forge.

  The following storage blocks are currently supported by ZPM in any
  official capacity:

     IC2 MFE, MFSU, and BatBox
       In drain mode, these blocks are kept completely empty. In fill mode,
       the blocks are kept completely full.

     IC2 Machines (anything implementing IEnergySink, eg. the macerator)
       In drain mode, nothing happens. In fill mode, up to 4096 EU/t is
       pumped into the machine in packets of 32 EU until the machine is
       full. (Both of these numbers can be configured in the configuration
       file)
